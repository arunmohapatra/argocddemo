Modern software architecture encompasses a wide range of principles, practices, and technologies. Here are some key parameters that are commonly considered:

Scalability: 
	The ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of work or traffic by adding resources or nodes to the system.

Reliability: 
	The system's ability to perform consistently and predictably under varying conditions, including handling errors gracefully and recovering from failures.

Security: 
	Ensuring that the system and its data are protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

Modularity: 
	Breaking down the system into smaller, self-contained modules or components that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

Flexibility: 
	The ease with which the system can be adapted or extended to meet changing requirements or integrate with other systems.

Performance: 
	Ensuring that the system meets acceptable levels of responsiveness and throughput, often through optimization and performance tuning.

Maintainability: 
	Designing the system in a way that makes it easy to understand, update, and troubleshoot over time, including clear documentation and coding standards.

Interoperability: 
	The ability of the system to communicate and exchange data with other systems, often through standardized protocols and interfaces.

Resilience: 
	Designing the system to withstand and recover from failures or disruptions in the underlying infrastructure or environment.

Cloud-Native Considerations: 
	Leveraging cloud computing principles and services such as microservices, serverless computing, and containerization to build and deploy highly scalable and resilient applications.

Event-Driven Architecture: 
	Designing systems that respond to and emit events, enabling loosely coupled and asynchronous communication between components.

Data Management: 
	Implementing effective strategies for storing, accessing, and processing data, including considerations for data consistency, availability, and partitioning.

Automation: 
	Utilizing automation tools and practices for deployment, testing, monitoring, and scaling the system to improve efficiency and reliability.

DevOps Practices: 
	Integrating development and operations teams and processes to streamline software delivery, deployment, and infrastructure management.

Compliance and Governance: 
	Ensuring that the system complies with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, and implementing governance mechanisms to manage risk and ensure accountability.

These parameters are not exhaustive and may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of the software architecture being developed.
